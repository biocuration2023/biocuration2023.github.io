The Annual International Biocuration Conference provides a forum for curators, developers, and
users of clinical and life sciences data, knowledge, and models to discuss their
work, promote collaboration, and foster the community around this active and
growing area of research. Participants from academia, government, and industry
interested in the tools, methodology, and philosophy of curation in the clinical
and life sciences are encouraged to attend and submit an abstract for
consideration for an oral or poster presentation. This conference is organized in part with the
[International Society of Biocuration](https://www.biocuration.org).
