This page contains the decision letters that were sent to abstract submitters. We were
very happy with the submissions and ended up accepting everything that was in scope.
There were only 3 abstracts that were not written with a perspective on curation which
we invited for revision and reconsideration, but the authors did not take the opportunity.

## Accept for Long Talk

We are pleased to inform you that we have accepted your abstract for oral presentation at Biocuration 2023. You will
have 20 minutes to present, including questions. We suggest limiting your talk to 15 minutes and leaving 5 minutes for
questions.

You will be able to find your speaker slot in the conference agenda, which will be posted early next week
to https://biocuration2023.github.io. Speakers may also give an optional poster presentation corresponding to their oral
presentation, but we ask that you please inform us by emailing biocuration2023@gmail.com.
Please email us a copy of your slides before the conference to biocuration2023@gmail.com so we can pre-load them in your
session's room. Ideally, this will be through Google Slides to ensure display is consistent on all systems. We can also
accept Powerpoint, Numbers, or equivalent, but can not be responsible for any style issues that result. We will
additionally be posting all presentations to the International Society of Biocuration's F1000 channel under a CC BY
license following the conference. If you have any questions or concerns about this, please do not hesitate to contact
us.

Lastly, though it goes without saying, at least one author from your submission must register for Biocuration 2023 via
URL: https://registrations.meetandwork.com/Login.asp?IDcommessa=MW23008.

We're very excited to see you in Padua. Please feel free to connect with us on Mastodon, Twitter, or LinkedIn in the
meantime :)

be two back-to-back poster presentation sessions for 1 hour each. You will be responsible for presenting your poster at
one of these sessions based on your poster number (which will be assigned when you arrive).
Posters should be at a maximum 90cm wide and 100-110cm tall. We will provide materials for hanging your posters. We
suggest that posters include a QR code that viewers can scan that either link to a downloadable version of the poster or
other relevant resources.

biocuration2023@gmail.com. We can also accept PowerPoint, Numbers, Google Slides, or equivalent format. We will post all

## Reject for Out of Scope

We are nearing completion of the reviewing process for the Biocuration 2023 Conference. Unfortunately, your submission
has been rejected for poster presentation as it did not adequately highlight how biocuration is part of your research.
We would however, reconsider your poster if you were to revise your abstract in a way that emphasizes the present or
future need for representing or structuring your data in compliance with biocuration standards. Please send us a revised
version before Monday, January 30th, 2023 via email to biocuration2023@gmail.com. We will review the modified abstract
and promptly let you know if the changes are sufficient to accept your submission for a poster.
