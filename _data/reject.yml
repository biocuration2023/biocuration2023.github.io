- abstract: 'Background: Leprosy, caused by the slow-growing acid-fast bacilli Mycobacterium
    leprae, continues to be a belligerent public health hazard for the causation of
    high disability and eventual morbidity cases with stable prevalence rates, even
    with treatment by the ongoing multidrug therapy (MDT) composed of dapsone (DDS),
    rifampicin, and clofazimine. These primary anti-leprosy drugs are constantly rendered
    ineffective due to mutations in their respective target enzymes. DDS resistance
    most often occurs due to mutations in the bacterial folic acid biosynthesis nodal
    enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) at codon positions Thr53 and Pro53, based
    on literature. Thus, the development of DDS-optimized therapeutic candidates against
    DDS-resistant M. leprae (DRML) is a potent targeted therapy approach followed
    by cost-effective and resource-saving bioinformatics tools. Objective: The primary
    objective is to chemically hybridize DDS with various phytochemical derivatives
    (dapsone-phytochemical conjugates, or DPCs) to increase the potency of DDS through
    phytochemicals. After the design of DPCs, the primary potency, drug-ability, and
    toxicity profiles were assessed using various online and standalone bioinformatics
    tools before synthesis and the gold-standard in vivo study with toxicity profiles.
    Materials and Methods: The proposed DPCs were verified by molecular docking with
    both wild-type and mutant-type Ml-DHPS enzymes using AutoDock 4.2, molecular dynamics
    simulation with GROMACS 5.1.4 at a time scale of 100 ns, physicochemical and pharmacokinetics
    by SwissADME, possible biological activity by PASS (prediction of activity spectra
    for substances), and toxicity by ProTox tools, respectively. After the synthesis
    of DPCs, the structural interpretation and characterization were carried out chemically
    by HNMR, FTIR, UV, LC-MS, SEM, etc. The in vivo anti-leprosy activity was monitored
    using the one and only available gold standard, ‘mouse-foot-pad propagation method,''
    with a WHO-recommended concentration of 0.01 mg/kg for 12 weeks. Furthermore,
    the most active form of DPC''s host toxicity was tested in vitro in cultured human
    lymphocytes (isolated umbilical cord blood). Results: All proposed DPCs demonstrated
    greater anti-leprosy activity with less variation and greater stability than native
    DDS; as a result, DPC4 emerged as the most promising candidate from computational
    prediction. From an in vivo DRML cell-infected mouse model, it was revealed that
    DPC4 decreased one-log bacilli cells in normal-resistant mouse footpads, but no
    bacilli cells were found in DDS-sensitive (tymectrimized irradiated) mouse footpads.
    Further, the in vitro host toxicity study confirmed that the DCP4 level up to
    5,000 mg/L was safe for oral administration since it found a minor number of dead
    cells under a fluorescent microscope. Conclusion: The results indicated that DPC4
    could be used in place of DDS in MDT. Overall, this phytochemical chemical conjugation
    may lead to the reactivation of existing clinically inactive drugs with a higher
    chance of success for phytochemicals in mainstream applications. In addition,
    the use of advanced bioinformatics tools is an ideal platform before synthesis
    and expensive experiments to select the most promising putative drug candidates
    from a bunch, which directly reduces the cost, time, and resources in mainstream
    medicine.'

- abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal disease, accounting for 75–85%
    of primary liver cancers. The conclusive research on miR-181c-5p’s role in hepatocarcinogenesis,
    whether it has oncogenic effects or acts as a tumor repressor, is limited and
    fluctuating. Therefore, the current study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-181c-5p
    in HCC in silico and in vivo. The bioinformatics analysis of miR-181c-5p expression
    data in HCC using several databases strongly shed light on its involvement in
    HCC development, but also confirmed the fluctuating data around its role. miR-181c-5p
    was proven here to have an oncogenic role by increasing HepG2 cells’ viability
    as confirmed by MTT analysis. In addition, miR-181c-5p was upregulated in the
    HCC positive control group and progressed the HCC development and malignant features
    by its forced expression in an HCC mouse model by targeted delivery using a LA-PAMAM
    polyplex. This is indicated by the cancerous gross and histological features,
    and the significant increase in liver function biomarkers. The functional enrichment
    bioinformatics analyses of miR-181c-5p-downregulated targets in HCC indicated
    that miR-181c-5p targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways and
    biological processes involved in HCC development. Fbxl3, an example for miR-181c-5p
    potential targets, downregulation and its correlation with miR-181c-5p were validated
    by qPCR. In conclusion, miR-181c-5p is upregulated in HCC and has an oncogenic
    role enhancing HCC progression.

- abstract: Breast cancer has become a major global health problem. Despite all efforts
    of epidemiological and experimental research, therapeutic concepts in cancer are
    still limited and unsatisfactory. Currently, gene expression datasets are widely
    used to discover the new biomarkers and therapeutic targets in diseases. In the
    present study, we analysed four datasets with accession number GSE29044, GSE42568,
    GSE89116, and GSE109169 retrieved from NCBI-GEO. We identified nine key genes
    namely PCOLCE2, LAMA2, TMTC1, ADAMTS5, TIMP4, RSPO3, COL11A1, MMP11, and COL10A1
    associated with the breast cancer. Among these genes, COL11A1, MMP11, and COL10A1
    were found up regulated and PCOLCE2, LAMA2, TMTC1, ADAMTS5, TIMP4, and RSPO3 were
    found down regulated. Similar expression profile of seven among nine genes (except
    ADAMTS5 and RSPO3) was validated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell
    lines. Further, we found that the genes namely LAMA2, TMTC1, and TIMP4 were significantly
    expressed among different age groups of patients. LAMA2 and TIMP4 were found significantly
    associated and TMTC1 gene was found less correlated with breast cancer occurrence.
    We found that the expression level of LAMA2, TIMP4, and TMTC1 was higher in all
    TCGA tumors and significantly associated with poor survival. We conclude that
    targeting these genes may pave the way for development of targeted therapy in
    cancer.
