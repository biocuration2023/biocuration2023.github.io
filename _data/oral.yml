- abstract: "The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, at www.uniprot.org) is a reference\
    \ resource of protein sequences and functional annotation that covers over 200\
    \ million protein sequences from all branches of the tree of life. \nUniProtKB\
    \ provides a wealth of information on protein sequences and their functions, including\
    \ descriptions of the nature of biologically relevant ligands (also known as cognate\
    \ ligands) such as substrates/products of enzymes, cofactors, activators and inhibitors,\
    \ as well as their binding sites. UniProtKB captures this information through\
    \ expert literature curation and from experimentally resolved protein structures\
    \ in the Protein Data Bank (PDB/PDBe).\nHere we describe improvements to the representation\
    \ of cognate ligands in binding site annotations in UniProtKB using the chemical\
    \ ontology ChEBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/). In 2022, we performed a complete reannotation\
    \ of all cognate ligand binding sites in UniProtKB, replacing textual descriptions\
    \ of defined ligands with stable unique identifiers from the ChEBI ontology, which\
    \ we now use as the reference vocabulary for all new ligand annotations. The last\
    \ UniProt release includes about 800 unique cognate ligands from ChEBI, which\
    \ feature in over 65 million binding site annotations and over 15 million protein\
    \ sequence records. This work continues the standardization of small molecule\
    \ annotation in UniProtKB, which also covers the use of Rhea (www.rhea-db.org)\
    \ and ChEBI for the annotation of enzymes, transporters, and cofactors. This enhanced\
    \ dataset will provide improved support for efforts to study and predict functionally\
    \ relevant interactions between proteins and their cognate ligands using computational\
    \ approaches. Users can access the dataset via the UniProt website, REST API,\
    \ and SPARQL endpoint, which have been modified to support ligand searches using\
    \ the chemical ontology and chemical structure data of ChEBI."

- abstract: "The Single Cell Expression Atlas knowledge base analyses curated, high\
    \ quality gene expression data at the level of single cells. Data are then displayed\
    \ through dimensionality reduction plots and heatmaps to show how cells cluster\
    \ based on their expression profiles.  However, in order to truly understand how\
    \ expression profiles define cell populations and are altered by perturbations,\
    \ expression profiles need to be linked to cell types and novel subpopulations\
    \ identified.  Thus, the single cell anatomogram project was born. Its aim is\
    \ to display cell types realistically within their parent structures alongside\
    \ cell types provided by the data submitter. Anatomograms are now available representing\
    \ adult tissues for lung; placenta; kidney; pancreas and liver. \n \nThe single\
    \ cell anatomogram project is a diverse collaboration between scientific experts,\
    \ curators, ontologists, artists, bioinformaticians and web developers to derive\
    \ interactive images which show cells at single cell resolution within the wider\
    \ context of the tissue. These images allow users to delve into lifelike representations\
    \ of organ structures from macro-structures down to single cells within the tissue.\n\
    \ \nInitially, artists work with curators and scientific experts, creating true\
    \ to life shapes from real data, such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence\
    \ images to create structures and cell types 'in situ'. Cell shapes and detailed\
    \ structures are layered on top of the tissue structure like a cake. Each shape\
    \ is mapped either to an existing ontology term or a new term and relationships\
    \ are created, in collaboration with ontologists from UBERON and Cell Ontology.\
    \ This allows us to recreate the existing biological hierarchy from structure\
    \ to cell type e.g. kidney > nephron > loop of Henle > epithelial cell of loop\
    \ of Henle.\n \nOnce illustrations have been created, mapped to their ontology\
    \ identifiers and the appropriate hierarchy defined, these constructs are then\
    \ incorporated into the Single Cell Expression Atlas by our web development team.\
    \ Developers ensure that the resulting images are interactive and users can select\
    \ regions within a tissue to ‘zoom into’ down to the level of individual cells\
    \ within sub-structures of that tissue. This is enabled by the standardised bioinformatics\
    \ analysis pipelines that adequately merge data with curated metadata.\n\nLast,\
    \ but not least, is the data and cell types inferred from expression profiles.\
    \ Author-defined inferred cell types are mapped where possible to ontology terms\
    \ allowing us to identify the same cell types across multiple datasets. Once a\
    \ user lands on these datasets, the anatomograms are displayed alongside a heatmap\
    \ showing the top 5 genes per cell type associated with that dataset. When a cell\
    \ type ‘shape’ is selected this then lights up showing that population, giving\
    \ context to the data. Thus anatomograms provide a new perspective on visualisation\
    \ of multi-layered biological information at the single cell level."

- abstract: 'Genomics England’s PanelApp (https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/)
    is a knowledgebase which stores virtual gene panels relating to human conditions
    including rare diseases and cancer. It supports England’s NHS Genomic Medicine
    Service (GMS) by defining focused panels of genes with convincing evidence of
    disease causation. Such genes are deemed suitable for clinical genome interpretation,
    in turn enhancing diagnostic ability in a clinical setting.

    Support for gene involvement in a human disorder is derived from a combination
    of sources including published scientific literature and evidence from experts
    in the scientific and clinical communities, submitted as PanelApp gene reviews
    – a powerful integrated feature of the web interface. However, with the large
    volume of data relating to gene-disease relationships, maximising impact on scientific
    or clinical decision-making has become increasingly challenging.

    Manual curation remains integral for making final decisions on gene panel content,
    but due to the demands of maintaining nearly 200 panels, PanelApp curators have
    developed methods for prioritising gene-disease associations for assessment. External
    reviewer activity is extracted weekly, and reviews are automatically assigned
    categories of priority based on current and suggested gene rating classifications,
    ensuring evidence that may lead to changes to diagnostic-grade genes is assessed
    in a timely manner. Tracking tickets are created and assigned to curators based
    on disease specialities, enabling curators to become familiar with disease areas
    and specific panels. Tracking of reviews also enables concerted curation effort
    on the most frequently used panels, facilitating focused investigation with maximal
    downstream patient benefit. In parallel this highlights panels with minimal activity
    allowing curators to attribute this to limitations in disease knowledge or unmet
    community engagement needs. Active engagement of the PanelApp team with reviewer
    communities increases the valuable contributions from clinical specialists and
    aids delivery of results that are aligned with current clinical expertise.

    High quality panels have been shown to increase diagnostic yield in the NHS GMS,
    driving improved clinical utility for patients with rare diseases and cancer,
    and further emphasising the importance of a strategic approach for effective panel
    maintenance by curators.'

- abstract: 'Host-pathogen interaction maps offer the scaffold to understand the biological
    processes behind the pathogenicity of the microbe and also helps in identifying
    potential drug targets. Access to the experimental evidence and contextual metadata
    which influence the interaction outcome are critical for accurate interpretation
    of molecular mechanisms.

    The IMEx consortium (www.imexconsortium.org) is an international database collaboration
    that exists to record molecular interaction data from scientific literature and
    direct depositions and make it freely accessible to the public, using an Open
    Access, Open-Source model.

    IMEx curators use a detailed representation of experimental evidence in the scientific
    literature: details of the affinity tags used, the mutations influencing the interaction
    outcome, variable experimental conditions, chemical and biological inhibitors,
    agonists and antagonists and required post-translational modifications, all using
    standard ontologies and controlled vocabularies to add more value towards the
    interpretation of scientific experiments and the biology behind.

    In the context of host-pathogen interactions, more than 33K binary interactions
    of Human proteins with bacterial and viral proteins are captured in IMEx. Interactions
    with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS Coronavirus with human count more than 7500 binaries;
    and ~6300 binary interactions have been curated in IMEx for Influenza-human PPIs.
    More than 4200 protein interactions of humans proteins with plague-causing Yersinia
    pestis bacterium are available at IMEx and 3000 interactions between humans and
    the anthrax bacterium Bacillus anthracis have been curated. 8300 human-viral protein
    interactions with members of  Herpesvirus, Hepatitis and Papillomavirus family
    are also documented. Experimentally proven binding regions are available for more
    than 5000 interactions. More than 1000 interactions are shown to be affected by
    mutated protein sequence, compared to the wild-type protein. The IMEx’s MI scoring
    system for the molecular interactions based on the available experimental data
    are available to access the confidence behind every interacting pair.

    The IMEx consortium has been generating contextual molecular networks to reflect
    the type of relationship between the partners and over-laying metadata for the
    users to analyse those factors influencing the interaction outcome. This openly
    available resource is an invaluable tool with immediate applications in the study
    of variation impact on the interactome, sub-networks generated by mutated partners,
    small molecules affecting the networks, interaction interfaces as drug targets,
    among other key questions.'

- abstract: 'The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; card.mcmaster.ca)
    is an ontologically-driven knowledgebase and bioinformatics resource on the molecular
    biology and chemical components of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This is achieved
    by integrating the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) with the CARD Model Ontology
    (MO), which is used to organize AMR gene (ARG) sequences, resistance-conferring
    mutation data and bioinformatic parameters for in silico ARG detection by CARD’s
    Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) software. To preserve integrity over time, the
    ARO is routinely updated by a biocuration team through, for example, the addition
    of novel AMR genes or gene variants or the revision of existing ontology branches
    for clarity, accuracy and/or computational efficiency. While manual curation of
    the literature and sequences is a cornerstone of CARD’s curation philosophy, the
    volume of AMR scientific literature renders this approach time-consuming and impractical.
    We therefore developed CARD*Shark, an algorithm and software for computer-assisted
    AMR literature triage. The current iteration, CARD*Shark 3, identifies and prioritizes
    literature for review through a machine-learning methodology, which is then reviewed
    by a CARD biocurator. CARD thereby integrates continuous curation from multiple
    approaches: computer-assisted literature triage, identification of errors and
    oversights through public feedback such as our GitHub repository (https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation),
    and targeted curation within collaborative projects or other efforts of specific
    foci. To date, the ARO includes over 6500 terms which combine with 5000 ARG reference
    sequences and almost 2000 resistance-associated variants sourced from over 3000
    publications to produce the current version of CARD. This manually curated data
    is used as a baseline for in silico prediction of resistomes and ARG prevalence
    for over 300 pathogens. Here we provide an overview of CARD’s design, curation
    methodology and overall content scope, and illustrate how a computer-assisted
    curation approach improves our efficacy and accuracy.'

  title: The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database - Curating the Global Resistome
- abstract: 'Many model organism databases, pathway databases, ontologies, and other
    curated resources that support research in the life and natural sciences combine
    expert-curated data with surrounding software code and services. However, such
    resources are often maintained internally by members of a single institution and
    are therefore susceptible to fluctuations in funding, personnel, and institutional
    priorities. Too often, resources go out of date, are abandoned, or become inaccessible,
    for example, when a grant runs out or a key person moves on. Therefore, we need
    better solutions for creating resources that are less susceptible to such external
    factors and can continue to be used and maintained by the community that they
    serve.


    We propose a new model for the creation and maintenance of curated resources that
    promotes longevity through a combination of technical and social workflows, and
    a progressive governance model that supports and encourages community-driven curation.
    1) The technical aspect of our model necessitates open data, open code, and open
    infrastructure. Both code and data are permissively licensed and kept together
    under public version control. This enables anyone to directly suggest improvements
    and updates. Further, automation is used for continuous integration (e.g., semi-automated
    curation, quality assurance) and continuous delivery (e.g., static website generation,
    export in multiple formats). 2) The social aspect of our model first prescribes
    the composition of training material, curation guidelines, contribution guidelines,
    and a community code of conduct that encourage and support potential community
    curators. Second, it requires the use of public tools for suggestions, questions,
    discussion as well as social workflows like pull requests for the submission and
    review of changes. 3) The governance aspect of our model necessitates the division
    of responsibilities and authority (e.g., for reviewing/merging changes to the
    code/data) across multiple institutions such that it is more robust to fluctuation
    in funding and personnel that can also be updated over time. It prescribes liberal
    attribution and acknowledgement of the individuals and institutions (both internal
    and external to the project) who contribute on a variety of levels (e.g., code,
    data, discussion, funding). More generally, our model requires that a minimal
    governance model is codified and instituted as early as possible in a project''s
    lifetime.


    This talk will provide a perspective on how existing resources relate to our model,
    describe each of our model’s aspects in more detail (illustrated through the Bioregistry
    resource), and provide a practical path towards both creating new sustainable
    resources as well as revitalizing existing ones.'

  title: Promoting the longevity of curated scientific resources through open code,
    open data, and public infrastructure
- abstract: "Biological knowledgebases are a critical resource for researchers and\
    \ accelerate scientific discoveries by providing manually curated, machine-readable\
    \ data collections. However, the aggregation and manual curation of biological\
    \ data is a labor-intensive process that relies almost entirely on professional\
    \ biocurators. Two approaches have been advanced to help with this problem: i)\
    \ a computational approach that is based on natural language processing (NLP),\
    \ text mining (TM) and machine learning (ML)); and ii) the engagement of researchers\
    \ (community curation). However, neither of these approaches alone is sufficient\
    \ to address the critical need for increased efficiency in the biocuration process.\
    \ Our solution to these challenges is an NLP-enhanced community curation portal,\
    \ Author Curation to Knowledgebase (ACKnowledge). The ACKnowledge system, currently\
    \ implemented for the C. elegans literature, couples statistical methods and text\
    \ mining algorithms to enhance community curation of research articles. \n\nCurrently,\
    \ the ACKnowledge system asks authors to verify five different types of entities\
    \ (e.g. genes, variations) and fourteen different data types (e.g. phenotype,\
    \ physical interaction) identified by our TM and ML approaches.  We are now expanding\
    \ the ACKnowledge system to incorporate ML models to identify sentences that describe\
    \ specific types of experiments and then extract entities and concepts for more\
    \ detailed author curation.  Specifically, we are training classifiers to identify\
    \ sentences that describe two types of experiments: 1) anatomical expression patterns\
    \ and 2) protein kinase activity.\n\nTo develop these models, we began by manually\
    \ extracting and labeling sentences in previously curated papers.  For each sentence,\
    \ we note the presence or absence of specific features, e.g. gene names or synonyms,\
    \ anatomy terms, or keywords such as ‘phosphorylation’, and label each sentence\
    \ as ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ depending on whether they contain the specific data\
    \ types analyzed, e.g. the sentence directly reports an experimental result or\
    \ the sentence describes an experimental set up related to anatomical expression\
    \ pattern or protein kinase activity.  In addition, we note metadata such as the\
    \ paper section in which a sentence is found.  \n\nUsing these sentences as training\
    \ data, we will build a set of models to classify sentences based on their text\
    \ similarity with sentences in the initial training set. We will transform each\
    \ sentence into a vector using a pre-trained embedding model (BioSentVec - https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioSentVec)\
    \ and will calculate their cosine similarity as a proxy of the semantic similarity\
    \ of the sentences. We will then train a binary classifier based on a similarity\
    \ threshold: if a sentence has cosine similarity with the average sentence in\
    \ our training set that is higher than a certain threshold we classify the sentence\
    \ as positive, otherwise as negative. \n\nIf the performance of the sentence-level\
    \ classifiers is satisfactory, we will apply the sentence classifier to papers\
    \ and display the identified sentences, along with extracted entities and concepts,\
    \ to authors in a table-like format where they can verify the suggested curatorial\
    \ statement. Author validated statements will then be vetted by curators and integrated\
    \ in knowledgebases including the Alliance of Genome Resources (https://www.alliancegenome.org)."

  title: 'ACKnowledge: expanding community curation to include fact extraction using
    artificial intelligence'
- abstract: 'Knowledge graphs (KGs) are representations of heterogeneous entities
    and their diverse relationships. Though KGs combine intuitive data models with
    massive data collections, their application to domain-spanning questions in biomedicine
    is constrained by the effort required to consistently bridge gaps between a massive
    array of frequently-updating resources. We sought to develop a KG in the context
    of the NIH-sponsored Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project with this
    challenge in mind. IDG research is focused on improving our understanding of the
    properties and functions of proteins that are currently unannotated within three
    commonly drug-targeted protein families: G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels,
    and protein kinases. Accordingly, we designed KG-IDG to integrate otherwise uncoordinated
    sources of drug vs. target information, e.g., drug properties and target interactions
    from the DrugCentral resource; protein target details from the Target Central
    Resource Database; diseases/phenotypes from MONDO, OMIM, Orphanet, and the HPO;
    along with several other data sources and ontologies. The KG-IDG graph supports
    intensive graph-based machine learning methods for inference of novel relationships
    between drugs, proteins, and diseases.


    KG-IDG incorporates several concrete design elements to ease its application to
    specific research questions. All contents are built upon the Biolink Model, a
    data model purpose-built for flexible representation of biological associations
    in property graphs. All graph versions are assembled using the Knowledge Graph
    Exchange (KGX) platform, with all components following a highly modular and configurable
    data ingest and transformation pipeline. The greatest contribution KG-IDG makes
    to data FAIRness, however, is its adherence to reproducibility and open-source
    principles: all code, transformed data, and graphs are publicly available. All
    graph products are distributed in easily human-readable KGX TSV format. We feel
    that this overall approach allows KG-IDG to serve as the foundation for future
    KG construction efforts while also yielding interoperable, machine readable data
    resources. All code for assembling KG-IDG is available at https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-idg.'

  title: 'KG-IDG: A FAIR Knowledge Graph for Illuminating the Druggable Genome'
- abstract: "The use of common biomedical ontologies to annotate data improves data\
    \ findability, integration and reusability. Ontologies do this not only by providing\
    \ a standard set of terms for annotation, but via the use of ontology structure\
    \ to group data in biologically meaningful ways.  One way to take advantage of\
    \ this is via a knowledge graph in which ontologies and ontology semantics provide\
    \ the glue that links content annotated knowledge and data in well documented\
    \ and transparently queryable ways, providing an extensible base for building\
    \ a APIs and applications and a potential input to machine learning.\n\nOne barrier\
    \ to fulfilling this potential is the lack of easily-usable standardised infrastructure\
    \ for using ontologies and standard semantics to build and structure Knowledge\
    \ Graphs in a form suitable for driving web applications.  Triple stores can theoretically\
    \ fulfil this role, but remain a niche technology and their standard query language\
    \ (SPARQL) is not ideal to use for querying ontologies in OWL.  Ensuring that\
    \ web applications and APIs driven by knowledge graphs are easily usable by the\
    \ biomedical community requires mechanisms to harness the power of semantics to\
    \ label and categorise content in ways that are tailored to the application and\
    \ the community.\n\nTo overcome these barriers we built the Knowledge Graph Development\
    \ Kit - a highly configurable containerised pipeline for integrating ontologies\
    \ and curated information into easily queryable knowledge graphs.  The pipeline\
    \ consists of a triple-store integration layer that loads and integrates ontologies\
    \ and curated content (TSV templates that the pipeline converts to RDF), and 3\
    \ front end servers: An OWLERY server supporting OWL-EL queries across ontologies\
    \ and knowledge graphs; A Neo4j server that supports graph queries and visualisations\
    \ and provides an accessible knowledge graph representation;  A SOLR server that\
    \ supports tuneable autosuggest with default settings that are optimised for ontology\
    \ search and stores cached query results.\n\nA standard interconversion between\
    \ OWL and Neo4J is central to this pipeline. It is optimised for human readable\
    \ cypher queries and supports a highly configurable semantic tagging system built\
    \ on the Neo4J label system.  Semantic tagging is designed to harness the power\
    \ of ontology and knowledge-graph semantics to add short, easily understandable,\
    \ application-specific, human readable tags to ontology terms and annotated content.\
    \ These semantic tags can be used as badges to efficiently communicate with users\
    \ in terms that make sense to them, as a mechanism for configuring autosuggest\
    \ search, for faceted browsing and even for configuring a web application \n\n\
    We will present details of the pipelines and examples of their application in\
    \ 3 different applications:  Virtual Fly Brain, the Allen Brain Atlas Cell Type\
    \ Explorer and The Cell Annotation Platform."

- abstract: "High-quality manual curation - the process of reviewing and annotating\
    \ data manually - is critical for ensuring the reliability and validity of scientific\
    \ data. However, manual curation is also time-consuming and expensive so is unlikely\
    \ to be scalable to the large volume of data the life-sciences generate. \n\n\
    We have been experimenting with using machine learning models, such as BioBERT,\
    \ to perform some biocuration tasks using a 'human-in-the-loop' approach. One\
    \ task we commonly perform is the identification of entities of a particular type\
    \ in a corpus of text, and we will discuss in this talk the benefits and limitations\
    \ of ML for this task. In addition, we will expand on our work using ML models\
    \ for de-novo ontology building, synonym suggestion and relationship extraction.\n\
    \nWe propose that in the future biocurators time might be well-spent training,\
    \ validating and retraining ML models to allow their valuable scientific input\
    \ to be applied in a scalable way."
