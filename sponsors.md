## How to Sponsor Biocuration 2023

The Annual International Biocuration Conference provides a forum for curators, developers, and
users of clinical and life sciences data, knowledge, and models to discuss their
work, promote collaboration, and foster the community around this active and
growing area of research. Participants from academia, government, and industry
interested in the tools, methodology, and philosophy of curation in the clinical
and life sciences are encouraged to attend and submit an abstract for
consideration for an oral or poster presentation. This conference is organized in part with the
[International Society of Biocuration](https://www.biocuration.org).
We expect ~250-300 delegates, including a number of high profile speakers.

Sponsors typically benefit through increased community visibility through
branding and physical presence both at the conference and through ISB social
media channels. This often leads to interesting collaborations, new
clients/contracts/projects, or the recruitment of young, international curators
with a variety of backgrounds who attend the event.
