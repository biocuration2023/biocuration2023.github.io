The 16<sup>th</sup> Annual International Biocuration Conference (Biocuration 2023),
supported by the ISB, invites attendees to consider two grand challenges
for the future of biocuration and the growing biocuration community:

1. Given the widespread interest in making data, metadata, and knowledge more FAIR
   (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and TRUST-worthy
   (Transparency, Responsibility, User Focus, Sustainability, and Technology),
   how can the community move past these as superficial platitudes and towards
   real impact?
2. How can our community spread past the prefix of bio-
   and into adjacent domains of chemistry, clinical informatics, agriculture,
   ecology, and related natural sciences? These themes align with our community's
   core values of openness, transparency, collaboration, and reusability on both
   a philosophical and technical level.

We invite authors to submit abstracts (500 words maximum) for oral or poster presentations at
Biocuration 2023 that highlight their recent work in either biocuration or
more broadly curation in the life, natural, or computational sciences.
Submissions can span disciplines such as the generation of curated resources
(e.g., databases, ontologies), the development of methods (e.g., natural
language processing, machine learning-based analyses), the philosophy of
curation, and ultimately the applications and analyses relying on curated
resources.

List of suggested topics for Submission:

- **Generation, annotation, and curation of resources**: Efforts for the curation
  of data from non-peer-reviewed resources, medical and clinical data, data from
  biobanks and sample repositories, and omics data resources
- **Data standards and ontologies**: Data standards, models, terminologies,
  and ontologies that use existing standards to augment and support the
  organization of knowledge for supporting and enhancing biocuration efforts
- **Development of methods and techniques**: Development of methods such as
  text mining, natural language processing (NLP), and machine-learning approaches
  to automate or assist the process of curation
- **Development of curation tools**: Efforts into the development and
  maintenance of curation tools
- **Application and analyses**: Work that describe analyses and applications
  of curated data and resources
- **Initiatives to strengthen the Biocuration community**: Initiatives that aim
  to strengthen the Biocuration community and find alignment with other
  communities that are similar or adjacent to life sciences
- **New challenges in Biocuration**: What are the current challenges observed
  within the Biocuration community and how can we, as a community, bring together
  people and resources to solve these challenges
- **Beyond FAIR**: Ideas for going beyond FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
  Interoperable, Reusable) principles and finding ways to realize the potential
  and benefits of FAIR data and resources
- **Future of Biocuration**: Views into the future of Biocuration, especially
  in light of recent advances with Large Language Models and Artificial
  Intelligence

The above topics are not exhaustive and we welcome other topics that are related
to Biocuration efforts as well.
