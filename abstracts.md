The 16th Annual International Biocuration Conference (Biocuration 2023),
supported by the ISB, invites attendees to consider two grand challenges
for the future of biocuration and the growing biocuration community. First,
given the widespread interest in making data, metadata, and knowledge more FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and TRUST-worthy
(Transparency, Responsibility, User Focus, Sustainability, and Technology),
how can the community move past these as superficial platitudes and towards
real impact? Second, how can our community spread past the prefix of bio-
and into adjacent domains of chemistry, clinical informatics, agriculture,
ecology, and related natural sciences? These themes align with our community's
core values of openness, transparency, collaboration, and reusability on both
a philosophical and technical level.

We invite authors to submit abstracts for oral or poster presentations at
Biocuration 2023 that highlight their recent work in either biocuration or
more broadly curation in the life, natural, or computational sciences.
Submissions can span disciplines such as the generation of curated resources
(e.g., databases, ontologies), the development of methods (e.g., natural
language processing, machine learning-based analyses), the philosophy of
curation, and ultimately the applications and analyses relying on curated
resources.

### Abstract Submission

Abstracts can be submitted to be considered for oral presentations or
poster presentations through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=biocuration2023).

### Workshop Proposals

Workshop proposals can be submitted for consideration through [this form](https://forms.gle/iYUu2RN25TgUMW7x9).
