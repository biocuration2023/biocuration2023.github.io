Biocuration is the act of organizing, cataloging, or structuring data within the life and natural
sciences to make it more useful and reusable. The outputs of biocuration activities are ubiquitously
used by laboratory scientists, computational scientists, and other researchers in their daily workflows. 

The International Society of Biocuration (ISB) is a non-profit organization for biocurators, developers,
and researchers with an interest in biocuration. It promotes the field of biocuration and provides a forum
for information exchange through meetings and workshops. Since its foundation, the ISB has supported
hosting 15 annual international biocuration conferences across three continents, supported local meetings
in several countries, and provided recognition of both the lifetime achievements of senior curators and
increasing more the work of early career researchers.

The 16th Annual International Biocuration Conference (Biocuration 2023), supported by the ISB, invites
attendees to consider two grand challenges for the future of biocuration and the growing biocuration
community. First, given the widespread interest in making data, metadata, and knowledge more FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and TRUST-worthy (Transparency, Responsibility,
User Focus, Sustainability, and Technology), how can the community move past these as superficial
platitudes and towards real impact? Second, given how can the community spread past its prefix of
bio- and into adjacent domains of chemistry, clinical informatics, agriculture, ecology, and related
natural sciences? These themes align with our community's core values of openness, transparency,
collaboration, and reusability on both a philosophical and technical level.

We invite authors to submit abstracts for oral or poster presentation at Biocuration 2023 that highlight
their recent work in either biocuration or more broadly curation in the life, natural, or computational
sciences. Submissions can span displines such as the generation of curated resources (e.g., databases,
ontologies), the development of methods (e.g., natural language processing, machine learning-based
analyses), the philosophy of curation, and ultimately to the applications and analyses relying on
curated resources.


Abstracts can be submitted to be considered for oral presentations or poster presentations through
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=biocuration2023).


Workshop proposals can be submitted for consideration through [this form](https://forms.gle/iYUu2RN25TgUMW7x9)
